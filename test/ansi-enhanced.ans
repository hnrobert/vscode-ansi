Enhanced ANSI Escape Sequence Demonstration
============================================

1. Basic formatting (existing functionality):
[31mRed text[0m
[1;32mBold green text[0m
[4;34mUnderlined blue text[0m

2. DEC Private Mode sequences:
[?1hApplication cursor keys enabled
[?25lCursor hidden (you won't see this effect in VS Code)
[?1000hMouse tracking enabled
[?47hSwitched to alternate screen buffer
Normal text with private modes set
[?47l[?1000l[?25h[?1lModes reset

3. Cursor positioning and movement:
[HCursor moved to home (1,1)
[5;10HCursor moved to row 5, column 10
[3ACursor moved up 3 lines
[2CCursor moved forward 2 columns
[sCursor position saved
More text here
[uCursor position restored

4. Screen and line manipulation:
[2JScreen cleared (conceptually)
[KLine cleared from cursor to end
[1KLine cleared from cursor to beginning
[2KEntire line cleared

5. Scroll operations:
[3SScrolled up 3 lines
[2TScrolled down 2 lines

6. OSC (Operating System Command) sequences:
]0;Enhanced ANSI Demo WindowWindow title set
]2;Demo Title\Alternative window title with ST terminator
]4;1;rgb:ff/00/00Color palette modified

7. Complex real-world example (like your original):
[?1h=[?1h=[?1h=[?1h=[?1h=URL: https://localhost:7118, latency: 0ms

8. Character set selection and line drawing:
(0
lqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqk
x  (B[32mSpecial characters mixed with color[0m(0  x
mqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqj
(B

9. Mixed formatting with control sequences:
[2J[H]2;Status Display
[1;1H[31;1m┌─ System Status ─┝[0m
[2;1H[32m│ [42;30m ONLINE [0m[32m          │[0m
[3;1H[33m│ Load: [43;30m 85% [0m[33m      │[0m
[4;1H[31;1m└──────────────────┘[0m
[6;1H[?25lProcessing...[?25h

10. Device status and attributes:
[6nCursor position report requested
[cPrimary device attributes query
[>cSecondary device attributes query
[!pSoft terminal reset

11. Others
=Equal sign (DECPAM) set

All these sequences are now properly recognized and marked as escape sequences
by the enhanced ANSI parser, providing better support for real-world terminal
output and log files.
